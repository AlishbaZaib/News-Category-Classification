# News Category Classification

This project focuses on building a text classification system to categorize news articles into the following categories:

- 🌍 World  
- ⚽ Sports  
- 💼 Business  
- 💻 Technology



## 📝 Implementation Steps

- Preprocessed the text using NLTK (stopword removal, lemmatization)
- Visualized top words in each category using bar charts
- Converted cleaned text into TF-IDF feature vectors
- Trained and evaluated the following models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - XGBoost Classifier
  - Neural Network (Keras)
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
- Visualized the training history of the Neural Network


## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- NLTK  
- Scikit-learn  
- XGBoost  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
